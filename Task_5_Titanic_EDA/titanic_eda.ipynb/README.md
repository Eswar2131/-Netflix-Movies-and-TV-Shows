# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends that influenced passenger survival.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we visualize and interpret data to derive meaningful insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the Titanic dataset structure
- Handle missing values and perform data cleaning
- Identify relationships between features (age, gender, class, etc.) and survival
- Visualize distributions and correlations using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Summarize key findings from the dataset

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation & cleaning
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical plots & heatmaps
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data analysis

## 📂 Dataset Source
[Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Pairplot** – Visualizing feature relationships
- **Heatmap** – Correlation matrix of numerical features
- **Histogram** – Age & fare distribution
- **Boxplot** – Fare vs Passenger Class
- **Scatterplot** – Age vs Fare by survival status

---

## 🔍 Observations
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers had better survival chances than lower-class passengers
- Younger passengers had slightly higher survival rates
- Missing data was mainly in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` columns

---

## 📑 Summary of Findings
The EDA clearly shows **socio-economic status, gender, and age** had significant effects on survival probability.  
Higher-class passengers and females had better survival rates, aligning with the "women and children first" rescue protocol.
